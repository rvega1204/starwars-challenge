Using React and Remix for frontend development, contestants will create an interactive webpage where users can explore species information efficiently. A key aspect of the challenge will be implementing a paginated base table (10 items per page) with row-click functionality to display statistics and details about the selected species, along with associated characters. With Tailwind CSS for styling and ShadCN components for UI enhancements, participants will craft a visually appealing and functional webpage that offers a comprehensive view of Star Wars species data.",
